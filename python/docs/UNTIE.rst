About UNTIE
-----------

Featrix includes a time module for all types of timestamp applications. Working with time is a huge pain for developers and ML teams alike--and UNTIE is here to help. We explode dimensions, calculate deltas, and analyze what carries signal for you, so you can feed encodings representing the best time dimensions for a dataset into your models, automatically.

You can see examples of UNTIE at work in our `Featrix demos <https://featrix.ai/demo>`_ (in particular, the Boston 311 dataset).
