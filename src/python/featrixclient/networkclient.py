        Create a Featrix client object.

        The caller has to provide authentication credentials. These are API Keys, generated on the Featrix website
        https://app.featrix.com.  An API Key will consist of a client id and a client secret.  Both are needed to
        use this interface.  The credentials can be provided to this interface three different ways (only one is
        required!):
            1) The client_id/client_secret arguments
            2) Having the client id and secret set in the environment variables FEATRIX_CLIENT_ID and
                FEATRIX_CLIENT_SECRET, typically put in the users .zshrc/.bashrc or Windows environment.
            3) Having the client id and secret set in the file ${HOME}/.featrix.key (or a file specified by
                the key_file argument below).  The format of this file is the same as the environment, two lines
                that contain:

                FEATRIX_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxxx
                FEATRIX_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxx

        To generate an API Key, register an account at https://app.featirx.com, and once logged in, under
        your Profile menu in the top right corner, select ``Manage API Keys``.

        Args:
            url(str): The url of the Featrix server you are using. The default is https://app.featrix.com

        """
        Create a new neural function in the current project.  If a project is passed in with the project_or_id
        argument, it is made the current project.  If the project_or_id is a string, if it is an object id
        (standard id for a FeatrixProject) we attempt to find that project and make it the current project.  If the
        string in project_or_id is not a valid object id, we assume it is a name to be used for creating a new
        project.

        If an embedding space is already trained or being trained in the project, we will use that embedding space
        to train the neural function model, otherwise we will first train an embedding space on the data files included
        in the project.  If a list of datasets are passed into this function, we will first upload and associate
        those files with the project being used.

        If the wait_for_completion flag is set, this will be synchronous and
        print periodic messages to the console or notebook cell.  Note that the jobs are enqueued and running
        so if the notebook is interrupted, reset or crashes, the training will still complete and can be queried
        by using the methods get_neural_function or neural_functions.

        In either case, a tuple is returned that includes the model and two FeatrixJob objects -- the first is
        the embedding space training job, and the second is the model training job.  If the embedding space was
        already training, the first job will be the last training job for that embedding space.

        The caller, in the case where they do not wait for completion, can follow the progress via the jobs objects
            ```
            model, es_training_job, nf_training_job = create_neural_function("field_name")
            if nf_training_job.completed is False:
                nf_training_job = nf_training_job.check()
                print(nf_training_job.incremental_status)
            ```

        They can also just wait on the neural function model's field training_state to be set to
        TrainingState.COMPLETED ("trained")

        Arguments:
            target_fields: the field name(s) to target in the prediction
            project: FeatrixProject or str id of the project to use instead of self.current_project
            credit_budget(int): the default credit budget for the training
            files: a list of dataframes or paths to files to upload and associate with the project
                        (optional - if you already associated files with the project, this is redundant)
            wait_for_completion(bool): make this synchronous, printing out status messages while waiting for the
                                    training to complete

        Returns:
            Tuple(FeatrixModel, Job, Job) -- the featrix model and the jobs associated with training the model
                         if wait_for_completion is True, the model returned will be fully trained, otherwise the
                         caller will need ot check on the progress of the jobs and update the model when they are
                         complete.
