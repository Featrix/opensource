        Create a Featrix client object.

        The caller has to provide authentication credentials. These are API Keys, generated in the Featrix UI, found at

        required!):
        1) The client_id/client_secret arguments
        2) Having the client id and secret set in the environment variables FEATRIX_CLIENT_ID and
        FEATRIX_CLIENT_SECRET, typically put in the users .zshrc/.bashrc or Windows environment.
        3) Having the client id and secret set in the file ${HOME}/.featrix.key (or a file specified by
        the key_file argument below).  The format of this file is the same as the environment, two lines
        that contain:

           FEATRIX_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxxxx
           FEATRIX_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxx

        To generate an API Key, register an account at https://app.featirx.com, and once logged in, under
        your Profile menu in the top right corner, select ``Manage API Keys``.

        Args:

        Create a new data explorer in the current project.  If a project is passed in with the project

        to find that project and make it the current project.  If the string in project is not a valid object id,
        we assume it is a name to be used for creating a new explorer project.

        If an embedding space is already trained or being trained in the project, we will use that embedding space

        in the project.  If a list of datasets are passed into this function, we will first upload and associate
        those files with the project being used.

        With an explorer project, we must first fully train an embedding space, and then a series of jobs will be
        started to create neural function models on each column in the embedding space.

        There are two waiting modes -- wait_for_completion will wait for both the embedding space and all of the
        model jobs to be completed before returning.  In this case it will return a tuple of the EmbeddingSapce
        and a list of models associated with the explorer project.

        If this is set to false but wait_for_model_jobs is set, the function will wait unitl the embedding space is

        list of Jobs associated with each model being worked on.

        If both wait_for_completion and wait_for_model_jobs are False, we will return a tuple of the Embedding space
        and the embedding space training job, unless the embedding space was already trained when the create was
        called, in which case we will revert to the return values as if wait_for_model_jobs was set (e.g.: a
        tuple of the embedding space and the model jobs).

        If either of the wait flags are set, but the notebook or script crashes during the operation, note that
        the full explorer creation procession is still operating and the caller can simpply look up the
        embedding space and call it's "get_training_jobs" and "get_model_jobs" method to inspect the progress.
