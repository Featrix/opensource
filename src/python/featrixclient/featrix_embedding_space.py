class FeatrixEmbeddingSpace(EmbeddingSpace):
    """
        Represents a multimodal embedding space.

        This lets you create multimodal embeddings for assorted tabular data sources in a single
        trained embedding space, building a foundational model on your data
        in such a way that you can query the entire data by using partial information that maps into
        as little as one of your original data sources, or you can leverage partial information
        spanning multiple data sources.

        You create embedding spaces in a project, and the training uses data files you have associated with
        the project in the training. You can use a subset of the data,
        ignore columns, or change mappings to rapidly experiment with models using this call.

        This function will use auto-join to find the linkage and corresponding overlapping mutual information between
        data files that have been loaded. Then a new embedding space is trained with the following columns:

        * Base data file: all columns (unless ignored in the ignore_cols parameter)
        * 2nd data file:  all columns, renamed to <2nd data file label> + "_" + <original_col_name>
                        However, the columns used for linking will not be present, as they
                        will get their mapped names in the base data file.

                        To ignore a column in the 2nd data file, specify the name in the
                        transformed format.
        * 3rd data file:  same as 2nd data file.

        This trains the embedding space in the following manner:

            Let's imagine the 2nd_file_col1 and 3rd_file_col2 are the linkage to col1 in the base
            data set. The training space will effectively be a sparse matrix:

        .. code-block:: text

                col1                    col2          col3        2nd_file_col2       2nd_file_col3       3rd_file_col2
