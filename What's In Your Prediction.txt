#                                 What's in *your* prediction?
#
# Every Featrix prediction returns is a JSON structure that includes:
# 
#   1. An ID to update Featrix on the ground truth if you discover the truth later.
#   2. An echo of your query to verify the query is what you expect.
#   3. Details on what Featrix actually processed and what, if anything, was ignored.
#   4. The actual prediction results (classification with probabilities or regression).
#   5. Safety information related to your query, based on the model's knowledge.
#   6. Metadata for fully reproducing the prediction and linking it to specific 
#      artifacts, whether they are Featrix artifacts or third party embedding models 
#      mixed with Featrix embeddings.
